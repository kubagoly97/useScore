<h1>useScore</h1>
An application that allows you to track the schedule, results and classifications of several top football leagues in Europe.
I used apifootball.com to fetch data, so you need an unique key to get every informations. Paymant is not necessary.

To run app - in project's folder:
- npm i
- npm run dev
